# TimelineJs Json Schema

A JSON Schema for validating timelinejs JSON files and for use with autocompletion systems. 

By comparision, the structure of the TimelineJs schema is rather complex, and quite a burden to define. So for this reason, the schema has been broken down into several different files, rather than one solitary file. 

## Getting Started

Using the schema SHOULD be as simple as including the link to the raw file in your own timelinejs json file.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- More sleep than I got last night.
- More time than I have creating it.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

    Give an example
